# Security Spec Testing

For the [Security Spec
Compliance](https://newrelic.atlassian.net/browse/PYTHON-2302) MMF, my job was
to review the [Agent
Security](https://source.datanerd.us/agents/agent-specs/blob/master/Agent-Security.md)
spec and file Jira tickets for anything we are out of compliance on. This is
the sample application I used for testing. Each endpoint demonstrates a
different item in the spec.
